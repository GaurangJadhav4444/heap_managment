# heap_managment
This project contains demonstration of memory allocation and de-allocation in heap.

Memory Allocation and Deallocation System
This program implements a simple memory allocation and deallocation system using a custom heap. It allows the user to allocate and free memory blocks, and it maintains the metadata to manage the heap effectively.

Notes
The Allocate function uses a first-fit strategy to find a suitable free block.
The Free function merges consecutive free blocks to minimize fragmentation.
The DisplayHeap function shows the start and end indices of each block along with its status.
This README provides an overview of the memory management system, explains the purpose of each function, and provides a simple usage example.
